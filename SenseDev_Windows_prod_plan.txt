SenseDev Windows Distribution Planning Document

Goal: Produce a double-clickable Windows .exe for SenseDev (v0.1.0-dev) that runs on a clean Windows machine without Java or command-line usage.

1. Scope & Success Criteria
In Scope

Windows desktop distribution only

Single executable (.exe)

JVM bundled

Manual distribution via GitHub Releases

Developer Preview quality (not signed, not auto-updating)

Out of Scope (explicitly)

macOS / Linux builds

Auto-updates

Installers with registry changes

Code signing

Telemetry / crash reporting

Definition of “Done”

.exe launches via double-click

Runs on a machine without Java installed

No .bat, Gradle, or terminal required

App window opens reliably

File system access works as expected

App can be zipped and shared

2. Current State (Baseline)

SenseDev is a Compose Multiplatform (Desktop JVM) app

App is currently launched via:

Gradle task

.bat wrapper

Build environment: Windows

No existing distribution artifacts

This implies:

JVM dependency currently implicit

No app metadata finalized (name, version, icon)

3. Chosen Distribution Strategy
Strategy

Compose Multiplatform Desktop → Native Windows distribution

Why this strategy

Officially supported

Bundles JVM

Produces native Windows artifacts

Lowest risk / highest credibility

Artifact Type

Primary: .exe

(Optional secondary: .msi, only if trivial)

For v0.1, .exe is sufficient and preferred.

4. Versioning & Identity (must be decided before build)
App Identity

App name: SenseDev

Display name: SenseDev

Internal ID: sensedev (or existing package name)

Versioning

Version: 0.1.0-dev

This version must appear in:

Build config

About window (later)

GitHub release tag

Do not use floating versions like “latest”.

5. Build Configuration Planning
JVM Target

Java 17 (LTS)

JVM must be bundled in the distribution

Architecture

x64 Windows

(ARM64 explicitly out of scope)

Packaging Mode

Release mode

Debug symbols not required

Optimizations enabled where supported

6. Distribution Output Layout (Expected)

After a successful build, you should have:

SenseDev-0.1.0-dev/
├── SenseDev.exe
├── runtime/        (bundled JVM)
├── app/            (compiled app)
├── resources/
└── SenseDev.ico


Or a single self-contained .exe depending on configuration.

You should verify:

The .exe runs if copied elsewhere

The folder can be zipped and redistributed

7. App Metadata Requirements

These must be finalized before building:

Required

App name

Version

Vendor / author (your name or “SenseDev”)

Description (1 line)

Window title

Icons

Windows .ico

Minimum:

256×256

128×128

64×64

Used for:

Window

Taskbar

File Explorer

Placeholder icons are acceptable for v0.1, but not defaults.

8. File System & Runtime Considerations (Critical)
Working Directory

Once packaged:

App will not run from project root

Relative paths may break

You must:

Audit any file access

Use:

User-selected paths

App-specific data directory

Absolute paths

Common Failure Points

Assuming cwd is project root

Hardcoded paths

Writing files next to .exe (may fail)

This step often reveals real bugs.

9. Windowing & Stability Checks

Before shipping the .exe, verify:

Required Checks

App launches at reasonable default size

App does not crash on:

First launch

Window resize

Minimize / restore

App closes cleanly

Your known resize crash must be addressed or explicitly documented.

10. Build Validation Checklist (Mandatory)

You must test the .exe under these conditions:

Clean Machine Test (or equivalent)

No Java installed

No Gradle

No project files present

Validation Steps

Double-click .exe

App opens

Core UI visible

Load a sample codebase

Exit app cleanly

If this fails, do not ship.

11. Naming & Output Conventions
File Name
SenseDev-0.1.0-dev-windows.exe


Avoid:

app.exe

desktop.exe

sensedev-final.exe

Folder Naming

Consistent with version and platform.

12. Known Limitations (to accept for v0.1)

These are acceptable and should be documented later:

Unsigned executable (Windows SmartScreen warning)

No auto-update

Windows-only

Developer Preview stability

Do not attempt to fix these now.

13. Post-Build Immediate Next Steps (not executed yet)

After .exe exists and runs:

Add About SenseDev window

Write installation documentation based on actual behavior

Create GitHub Release

These are explicitly downstream of this plan.

14. Stop Conditions (important)

You stop working on packaging when:

.exe launches reliably

You can share it via zip

You are confident it represents SenseDev honestly

Do not polish beyond this point yet.

Final Directive

Your only goal right now is:

Produce a working Windows .exe that runs without Java or the command line.

Everything else is secondary.

SenseDev UI/UX Beautification Planning Document

Version 1.0 – Complete Redesign Specification

Purpose

This document defines all visual, layout, interaction, and aesthetic improvements required to transform SenseDev from a functional engineering tool into a polished, beautiful, professional-grade developer product suitable for public release and, eventually, YC presentation.

The goal is to achieve an aesthetic quality comparable to:

Cursor AI

JetBrains IDEs

Raycast

Linear.app

VSCode

Sourcegraph Cody

While maintaining performance and clarity.

1. Core Visual Identity
1.1 Color Palette (Dark Theme Only for v1)

This is the modern dev-tool palette that feels premium and visually balanced.

Primary Backgrounds

Base background: #181818

Panel background: #1F1F1F

Hover/active surface: #252525

Borders / Lines

#2C2C2C thin 1px borders

#333333 for dividers

High-contrast but subtle

Accent Colors

Choose one accent family OR allow user theming:

Option A — Blue/Cyan (safe, modern):

Accent primary: #3ABEF9

Accent hover: #2E9FC9

Accent muted (icons): #76D9FF

Option B — Purple/Violet (standout, unique):

Accent primary: #6C63FF

Accent hover: #5A54DB

Accent subtle glow: #938CFF

Typography Colors

Primary text: #E3E3E3

Secondary text: #A8A8A8

Disabled text: #686868

Highlight text: accent color

This creates a visually consistent and pleasing dark UI.

2. Typography System

Use two fonts:

UI font:

Inter or SF Pro (fallback: Roboto)

Clean, modern, readable.

Code font:

JetBrains Mono

Fira Code (as fallback)

Enable ligatures.

Size scale:

15px → code & editor

14px → UI text

13px → secondary text

11px → tags / metadata

3. Layout Redesign (3-Pane Modern Dev Tool)

SenseDev should adopt the industry-standard triple-layout:

+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Top Toolbar (minimal, icon-based)                            |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Sidebar Tree | Graph View (Main)        | AI Chat Panel      |
|              |                          |                    |
|              |                          |                    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Bottom Status Bar                                      v1.0  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Why?

Familiar to developers (reduces friction to adoption)

Makes the app feel professional immediately

Works across all screen sizes

Encourages future extensibility (tabs, tools, inspectors)

4. Specific UI Improvements (Component-by-component)
4.1 Top Toolbar – Modern Minimal Look
Style:

Height: 48px

Background: panel color #1F1F1F

Border-bottom: 1px #2C2C2C

Elements:

App icon + “SenseDev”

Menu items (File, Project, AI, Settings)

Right-side: Model indicator (Gemini / OpenAI)

Optional: small search bar

Interactions:

Hover → background #252525

Active → accent underline

All icons → 18px Lucide style

4.2 Sidebar / File Tree
Visuals:

Background: #1F1F1F

Selected file highlight:
Rounded rectangle, background #252525, border accent color

Folder icons: chevrons, minimal

Auto-scroll into view for selected nodes

Improvements:

Smooth expand/collapse animation

Better indentation guides

Use smaller font for metadata (e.g., file size)

4.3 Graph View – The Centerpiece

This is the visual identity of SenseDev.
It must feel beautiful and memorable.

Node design:

Rounded rectangle, radius 8px

Background: #222222

Border: #303030

Node title: bright text

Node tag: small capsule badge (e.g., “ViewModel”, “Class”, “Flow”)

Subtle glow on hover (accent shadow 0 0 6px)

Edges:

Curved bezier lines

Color: #444 default, accent on hover

Arrowheads: small, subtle

Width: 1.5px

Grid / Background:

Faint dotted or lined grid (#222222 with 10% opacity)

Gives structure without noise

Interactions:

Click node → scroll code to position

Double click node → expand details panel

Drag to pan graph smoothly

Zoom with animated easing

Optional niceties:

Mini-map (bottom right)

Node grouping by module or package

“Star” important nodes

4.4 AI Chat Panel – Make It Look Like Cursor / Linear
Panel layout:
-------------------------------------
| AI Response/messages (scroll)     |
|-----------------------------------|
| Input box (floating, rounded)    |
-------------------------------------

Aesthetic changes:

Message bubbles with soft shadows

AI messages left-aligned

User messages right-aligned

Markdown rendering

Code blocks with syntax highlighting

Smooth scroll animation

Small pulses for incoming messages

Typing indicator ("•••")

Chat input:

Rounded bar (radius 10–12px)

Background: #252525

Border: 1px #333333

Placeholder: “Ask about this codebase…”

AI meta indicators:

Model used (e.g. Gemini 2.5 Flash)

Context used (“Graph | Code Snippet | File”)

Temperature or mode (optional)

4.5 Bottom Status Bar
Content:

Current file edited

Node count

Model status (Connected / Not Connected)

App version

Style:

Height: 28px

Background: darker (#161616)

Border-top: 1px solid #2C2C2C

5. Interactions & Animations (Subtle but huge impact)

Graph node hover: 3% scale up + small glow

Button hover: increase background shade

Toolbar item hover: subtle accent underline

Chat messages: fade-in + slide

Panel open/close: smooth ease-in-out

Tree expand: animated height transition

Highlight code section: 200ms yellow fade

All animations must be short (150–300ms).

These micro-interactions create a premium feel.

6. Modal & Settings Redesign

Settings must feel like a proper application settings panel:

Tabs:

General

AI Providers

Code Access

Appearance (future)

Experimental Features

Style:

Blurred backdrop

Rounded corners (12px)

Clear spacing

Icon beside each section

Accordions for large settings

7. Color Tags / Chips for Node Types

Give each node type an identity:

Node Type	Color
Activity	#4CC9F0
ViewModel	#4361EE
Repository	#F72585
Utility	#7209B7
Sensor Node	#F77F00
File	#A8A8A8

Add tiny rounded badges on each node.

8. Branding & Iconography
App Icon:

Minimal wave icon

Or orbit-like circles (Sense + Dev)

Purple/blue gradient

Splash screen (optional):

Logo centered

Fade-in animation

Consistent icons:

Use Lucide Icons (clean, modern)

9. Extremely Important: Developer Polish Signals

These small touches make a giant difference:

✔ Smooth resize transitions
✔ No jitter during graph panning
✔ Keyboard shortcuts
✔ Drag-and-drop project loading
✔ Quick search: Ctrl+P for files
✔ Ctrl+K for command palette (like VSCode)
✔ Error messages must be gentle and beautifully styled

These UX details directly influence how YC reviewers perceive product maturity.

11. Final Vision (Screenshot-less Verbal Mockup)

When SenseDev opens, it should look like a professional devtool, something between Cursor AI and JetBrains.

The emotional reaction should be:

“Oh, this looks legit.”

“I could actually use this daily.”

“This looks like a real startup product.”

That reaction is what gets test users…
Which is what gets traction…
Which is what gets YC interested.

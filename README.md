# SenseDev

SenseDev is a desktop tool for **visual exploration and understanding of software codebases**.

It is designed to help developers quickly build a mental model of how a codebase is structured, how components relate to each other, and where important logic lives — especially when working with unfamiliar or large projects.

This repository contains the **developer preview** of SenseDev.

---

## What SenseDev Is

- A **standalone desktop application**
- Focused on **codebase structure and relationships**, not editing
- Built for **developers onboarding onto new or complex codebases**
- A visual, graph-based aid for reasoning about code

---

## What SenseDev Is NOT

- Not an IDE
- Not a code editor
- Not a refactoring or code-generation tool
- Not a replacement for VS Code or JetBrains IDEs
- Not a runtime debugger

SenseDev is intentionally **read-only** and **analysis-focused**.

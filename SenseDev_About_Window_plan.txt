SenseDev — About Window

Planning, Design, and Architecture Document

1. Purpose of the About Window

The About SenseDev window serves three concrete goals:

Legitimacy

Confirms SenseDev is a real, versioned desktop product

Orientation

Explains what SenseDev is in one sentence

Traceability

Provides version + source reference (GitHub)

It is not a marketing page, changelog, or documentation entry point.

2. Scope (Strict)
In Scope

One modal / dialog window

Opened from Help → About SenseDev

Read-only informational UI

Desktop only

Explicitly Out of Scope

License text

Third-party credits

Update checks

Telemetry

Dynamic content

Navigation to other app views

This window must be stable for months without change.

3. UX Design Principles (Important)

The About window must:

Be small and calm

Avoid scrollbars

Avoid heavy branding

Match a developer-tool aesthetic

Feel native, not web-like

Tone

Serious

Minimal

Informational

No hype language

4. Visual Layout (Conceptual)
Window Characteristics

Type: Modal dialog (preferred) or fixed-size window

Resizable: ❌ No

Always on top of main window: ✅ Yes

Close methods:

“Close” button

ESC key

Window close (X)

5. Content Specification (Exact)
Mandatory Fields (v0.1)
Field	Value
App Name	SenseDev
Version	0.1.0-dev
Descriptor	“Developer Preview”
Description	“Visual codebase exploration and understanding tool for developers.”
Author	Your name
Platform	Windows
Link	GitHub repository

No emojis. No slogans.

Optional (Allowed, but not required)

Build date

Short disclaimer (“Early preview; features may change”)

6. Icon Usage

Use the same icon as the application icon

Size in About window:

64×64 or 96×96

No animation

No glow or effects

Purpose: identity confirmation, not decoration.

7. Interaction Model
User Actions

Click Close

Press ESC

Click window close (X)

No Other Interactions

No hyperlinks opening inside the app

External links open via OS browser only

8. Architectural Design
Component Responsibility
AboutWindow (UI Layer)

Stateless UI

Receives data as parameters

No business logic

No filesystem access

AboutInfo (Data Model)

A simple immutable structure containing:

appName

version

description

author

platform

repoUrl

This prevents:

Hard-coding text across UI

Future duplication

Data Source Strategy

For v0.1:

Version string is defined once

Passed into:

Main app

About window

Do not parse version from the executable or filesystem.

9. Lifecycle & Ownership

Window is created on demand

Destroyed on close

No retained state

No background threads

This guarantees:

Zero memory leaks

Zero side effects

10. Accessibility & Usability (Minimal but correct)

Text must be selectable

Buttons reachable via keyboard

Tab order:

Content → Close button

No need for screen-reader optimization at this stage.

11. Error Handling

There should be no failure states.

If:

Version missing → display “unknown”

Link missing → hide link section

The About window must never crash the app.

12. Testing Checklist (Before Shipping)

You must verify:

 Opens from Help → About SenseDev

 Window size is appropriate on 100% & 150% DPI

 ESC closes the window

 Close button works

 Icon renders correctly

 Text does not wrap awkwardly

 External link opens browser

Test using the packaged .exe, not Gradle run.

13. Future-Proofing (Without Implementing)

This design allows future additions without refactor:

License tab

Credits tab

Update channel info

But do not implement these now.

14. Stop Condition

You stop working on the About window when:

It opens reliably

Content is accurate

It feels boring and professional

That means it’s done.

Final Directive

The About SenseDev window is not a design playground.
It is a product stamp.

Implement it once, correctly, and move on.
